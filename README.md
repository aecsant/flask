About :This algorithm introduces a new approach to achieve loop-like behavior in software, without relying on traditional iteration constructs (such as for, while, or do-while loops) or recursive function calls.

Api Url : <domain>/api/AEE

Instead, it leverages a novel control model called Autonomous Emergent Execution (AEE), where execution is driven by decentralized units that make independent decisions based on their internal states and probabilistic triggers.

The key innovation lies in incorporating a quantum abstraction layer — where each unit simulates quantum-like behavior by maintaining a probabilistic state and performing virtual “measurements” to decide whether or not to execute. This probabilistic behavior mimics the stochastic outcomes of quantum systems and replaces deterministic control structures with emergent, state-driven execution flow.

In essence, this algorithm loops not by control flow, but by emergence, where units awaken, act, and evolve based on state transitions rather than by being explicitly called in a loop or recursively.

Title: Autonomous Emergent Execution (AEE): A Non-Iterative, Non-Recursive Execution Paradigm for Classical and Quantum-Inspired Computing Systems

Abstract:
This invention introduces a novel software execution paradigm called Autonomous Emergent Execution (AEE), which achieves repeated or loop-like behavior without utilizing conventional iteration constructs (e.g., for, while) or recursion. Instead, AEE relies on decentralized, self-governing computational units — referred to as AEE Units — that autonomously determine when to activate based on internal state, probabilistic rules, or external signals.

Each unit encapsulates its own logic for:

Awakening: Determining readiness for execution via a state-dependent condition, optionally influenced by simulated or real quantum measurement.

Action: Executing self-contained logic in response to activation.

Evolution: Altering its internal state or rules post-execution, enabling adaptive behavior across cycles.

AEE enables emergent loop-like behavior through dynamic reactivation of units, rather than through a central control structure or call stack. This makes it inherently suitable for quantum-inspired computing, distributed systems, and state-driven architectures.

A simulated quantum extension of AEE is also proposed, where each unit maintains a probabilistic internal state (analogous to a quantum superposition), performs simulated "measurements" to determine activation, and evolves probabilistically. The model supports realistic simulation of quantum feedback, quantum cellular automata, and future quantum AI ecosystems.

This invention may be implemented in classical programming environments (e.g., Python) and extended toward hybrid or native quantum computation using platforms such as Qiskit or Cirq. It opens new possibilities in quantum control flow, non-linear reactive systems, self-organizing software agents, and unconventional computation.
